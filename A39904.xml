            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is evident to every one that shall with any Attention read this <hi>Chapter,</hi> That the whole <hi>Design</hi> of it is, to confirm that <hi>great Article</hi> of the Christian Faith, [<hi>The Doctrine of the Resurrection of the Dead,</hi>] by several cogent <hi>Arguments;</hi> and to explain the <hi>manner</hi> of it by several apt <hi>Similitudes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now among those <hi>Arguments</hi> here used, my <hi>Text</hi> contains one, of that sort which <hi>Logicians</hi> call [<hi>ad hominem</hi>], <hi>i. e.</hi> such a one as is peculiarly adapted to conclude what is intended, from the Notions, <hi>Conces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,</hi> or other <hi>Circumstances</hi> of the <hi>Person</hi> that we ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue with. For the <hi>Apostle</hi> endeavours to convince those among the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> [who said, <hi>there was no</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vers. 12.</note>
               <hi>Resurrection of the Dead</hi>] of the absurdity of that Heretical Doctrine, from a generally-known <hi>Practice</hi> in the <hi>Church;</hi> and that <hi>allowed</hi> at least, if not <hi>approved</hi> and <hi>practised</hi> by themselves also; that of [<hi>Baptizing for the Dead</hi>], which could not rationally be done by them, or any else, with their approbation: except
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:64010:3"/> upon the supposal of the belief, (or profession, at least, of the belief) of that very <hi>Doctrine</hi> which they op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugned, [<hi>That those very dead should rise again</hi>]. For (saith he) <hi>to what purpose is that practice to those that are so baptized, if there be no Resurrection of the dead?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Argument</hi> of our Apostle is undoubtedly <hi>strong,</hi> and was unexceptionably <hi>constringent</hi> to <hi>those</hi> he had to deal withal: but cannot to us appear such, except we can clearly make out what that Phrase of [<hi>Baptising for the dead</hi>] in those <hi>Primitive times</hi> does import. Which therefore I shall spend some little time to inform you in, that I may make a clearer way to that, which from thence I have to recommend to you for your <hi>Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> and <hi>Practice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here, I will not undertake so tiresome a task, both to my own <hi>strength,</hi> and your <hi>patience,</hi> as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to you particularly all the several <hi>Interpretations</hi> given by <hi>Expositors</hi> of these words: which owe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the <hi>difficulty</hi> they are noted for, rather to <hi>their contests,</hi> than to their <hi>own obscurity:</hi> whereof, I hope to convince you by and by, when I have given you that which I judge most <hi>rational,</hi> and the <hi>grounds</hi> withal why I judge it so.</p>
            <p>And in order thereto, I shall make bold to use the <hi>common Rule</hi> for the <hi>Interpreting</hi> of <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> which forbids us, to <hi>hunt after figurative or mystical senses in any Text, where without evident inconveniences it may admit of a literal one.</hi> And I am greatly mistaken, if this will not do so in every <hi>word</hi> thereof. And <hi>first,</hi> the word [<hi>Baptized</hi>] though others interpret it <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphorically,</hi> I judge, properly denotes that <hi>Instituted Rite,</hi> by which our Saviour requires all to be <hi>admitted</hi> into the <hi>Christian Church,</hi> Mat. 28. 19.</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:64010:3"/>
            <p>2. By the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
               </gap>, or [<hi>the dead</hi>] I know no reason why we should not understand those that were <hi>naturally dead,</hi> for whose <hi>Resurrection</hi> the <hi>Apostle</hi> (as you were before told) does in <hi>this Chapter</hi> so strongly <hi>argue:</hi> but still with a special reference to those of them who <hi>died</hi> as <hi>Martyrs</hi> for the <hi>profession</hi> of <hi>Christianity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. And that those who are said to be <hi>baptized</hi> [for] <hi>them,</hi> are here affirmed to be so, as that word [<hi>for</hi>] signifies [<hi>in the stead</hi>] of them; I will here content my self to assert, hoping in what follows, to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate it.</p>
            <p>For in <hi>this sense,</hi> the Apostle's <hi>Argumentation</hi> (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering the constitution of those times, in which the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
               </gap>, or Christians already <hi>dead,</hi> were generally brought to their <hi>ends;</hi> and those that were not so, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger'd to be so, by Martyrdom) is very <hi>strong,</hi> and very aptly fitted, to make <hi>this verse</hi> coherent with those that <hi>precede,</hi> and <hi>follow</hi> it.</p>
            <p>For according thereunto, the <hi>Apostle's Argument</hi> here used, runs evidently to this purpose. The <hi>Christian Faith</hi> is to be propagated in the <hi>Jewish</hi> and <hi>Heathen</hi> world, by the <hi>blood</hi> of dying <hi>Martyrs.</hi> In which ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, divers are <hi>alread<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â¢</desc>
                  </gap> dead,</hi> and those that yet <hi>are not so,</hi> do yet <hi>die daily;</hi> that is, <hi>look</hi> upon <hi>themselves</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually as <hi>like to die,</hi> being in <hi>jeopardy</hi> of life <hi>every hour,</hi> v. 30, 31. yea, <hi>I my self,</hi> have on that account been exposed to <hi>death</hi> by the teeth of savage <hi>beasts at Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi> v. 32. And yet, 'tis notoriously known, that a <hi>suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession</hi> to the <hi>deceased Professors,</hi> of so <hi>hazardous</hi> a <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> is continually <hi>kept up</hi> in the Church, by <hi>admitting</hi> others, in great numbers, to <hi>fill</hi> their <hi>places</hi> so vacated by <hi>Baptism.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:64010:4"/>
            <p>But, <hi>if there be no Resurrection of the dead:</hi> (and so no such plenary <hi>reparation,</hi> or <hi>recompence</hi> for the <hi>loss</hi> of so dear an enjoyment as <hi>life</hi> is, when lost in <hi>Christ</hi>'s <hi>ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,</hi> as the Doctrine of the <hi>Resurrection</hi> imports:) How <hi>vain</hi> an attempt would it be, for us to persuade any intelligent Persons to be <hi>listed</hi> as his <hi>Soldiers</hi> into the vacant places of those that are so cut off? For on that supposition, well may those whom we by our Preaching invite to <hi>Baptism,</hi> ask, (as I do on their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half) <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã in non-Latin alphabet ã</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>what they shall do:</hi> or rather, <hi>What benefit or advantage</hi> can be propounded to induce them, (for so the word <gap reason="foreign">

            </p>
            <p>And against this sense of the words, I cannot fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see any thing material that may be likely to be urged, but only, these <hi>Two Objections;</hi> which therefore I must, before I proceed any farther in my Discourse, encounter, and rid my hands of them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>First</hi> is, That it seems too <hi>strictly</hi> to confine the <label type="milestone">

            <p>I. <hi>That the Church of Christ, (being an holy Society, ordained to consist of Members, existing in several successive Ages); ought to be maintained by the constant care of every preceding Age, to preserve the succession in those that follow them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. <hi>That whoever are to that end successively baptized into the Christian Religion, ought to be well grounded in the belief of the special benefits and advantages that are to be obtain'd thereby; and the way how they are to obtain them</hi>
            </p>
            <p>III. <hi>That the rational assurance which succeeding Christians have of their Predecessors interest in a future Resurrection, to a blessed Immortality, conduceth much to the Confirmation of them, in the belief amd practice of Christianity, even under the severest Circumstances.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of all these, I intend to discourse at this time, briefly, and plainly. And begin with the <hi>first.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>For this, the <hi>Apostle</hi> here intimates, was the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Practise</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> to <hi>Baptize</hi> others, to stand up in the <hi>room of the Dead:</hi> that the <hi>Commonwealth</hi> of <hi>Israel</hi> might not be (as the <hi>Historian</hi> tells us, that<note place="margin">Flor. c. 1.</note> of <hi>Rome,</hi> in its Plantation by <hi>Romulus,</hi> was like to have been,) <hi>Res unius aetatis,</hi> a <hi>short-lived Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> not to endure beyond <hi>the Age of man;</hi> but <hi>to expire</hi> with its <hi>present Members.</hi>

            <p>One of which is from the <hi>busy</hi> and <hi>restless activity</hi> of <hi>Jesuitical Incendiaries;</hi> and their too much influence (though at present much curbed) upon all the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish Courts</hi> in <hi>Europe;</hi> in pursuance of their declared <hi>Design</hi> of <hi>rooting out</hi> by Force and Arms, that which they call <hi>the Northern Heresy,</hi> (that is, indeed, our <hi>reformed Christianity,</hi>) out of the <hi>Earth,</hi> that the <hi>Name of Protestant</hi> may <hi>no more be had in remembrance:</hi> and we know, by sad experience, how near they lately were amongst us, to the accomplishing their <hi>cruel</hi> and <hi>bloody Intentions,</hi> after the <hi>patern</hi> of our <hi>Neighbour King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;</hi> where I need not tell you what <hi>proof</hi> they have made thereof.</p>
            <p>It is true indeed, that <hi>God hath, for a little space shewed us the favour, to leave us a nail,</hi> (as <hi>Ezra.</hi> 9. 8.<note place="margin">Ezra 9. 8.</note> says of <hi>Israel</hi> in his days) in his <hi>holy place: a little lightning of our eyes, and a little reviving to set up the house of our God, and repair the ruins thereof,</hi> (occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by our long continued <hi>divisions</hi> and <hi>dissentions,</hi>) under the <hi>Protection</hi> and <hi>Government</hi> of Their <hi>present Majesties:</hi> a Mercy, which one would think, none that has any true sense of <hi>Religion,</hi> should <hi>undervalue;</hi> seeing it is, under God, the greatest <hi>security</hi> we can likely have; for the <hi>perpetuity</hi> of the <hi>Gospel</hi> in its <hi>puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> and <hi>power,</hi> in these <hi>Nations.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>We therefore do very well, that we generally take care to tender our <hi>Children</hi> to <hi>Baptism</hi> in their <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy;</hi> for by this <hi>initiating Rite</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi>'s own <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment,</hi> we <hi>list</hi> them in his <hi>Family,</hi> we put on them his <hi>Livery,</hi> and <hi>dedicate</hi> them to his <hi>service.</hi> And herein, we take the course, which God himself took to perpetuate the <hi>Jewish Religion,</hi> in that <hi>chosen Nation,</hi> making their <hi>children,</hi> his <hi>children,</hi> and marking them (in their tend'rest Age,) as those that (in his own language, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 20.) were <hi>born to him;</hi> as such, by <hi>Circumcision.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And 'tis of great use, certainly, thus to <hi>anticipate</hi> our childrens <hi>election</hi> of their own <hi>Religion,</hi> whilst they are in our <hi>power</hi> to dispose of; as knowing how great an <hi>Argument</hi> it usually is, to sway our <hi>own choice,</hi> in the <hi>disposal</hi> of our selves, in any sort, when we ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive <hi>at years</hi> of <hi>election,</hi> that our <hi>Parents</hi> have <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destined</hi> us to some <hi>one</hi> way of <hi>living, calling,</hi> or <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,</hi> rather than any <hi>other,</hi> which is then offered to our <hi>Election.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then, it is as necessary, withal, that we <hi>train them up in the way wherein they ought to go;</hi> shew them <hi>what,</hi> and on what <hi>grounds,</hi> they are to <hi>believe,</hi> and<note place="margin">Prov. 22. 6.</note>

            </p>
            <p>But then, we must take heed, that we <hi>deliver</hi> it to them no otherwise than as we have <hi>received it from the Lord,</hi> and the <hi>generality</hi> of those, that before us, have <hi>died in him.</hi> For the <hi>Faith,</hi> we are all <hi>Baptized</hi> into, ought to be understood only of <hi>that,</hi> which <hi>all Christians</hi> have <hi>owned</hi> before us.

            </p>
            <p>And this <hi>practise,</hi> (by the way) is an apparent <hi>Confession,</hi> that (whatever they <hi>talk,</hi>) they do not indeed <hi>believe</hi> themselves, that those <hi>supernumerary Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles</hi> are really <hi>de fide,</hi> and of <hi>necessity</hi> to <hi>Salvation.</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:64010:11"/> Seeing their own publick form of Baptism admits such Proselytes into the <hi>Church,</hi> by <hi>Baptism,</hi> without them: It seems plain therefore, that (by consequence) they cannot, (without a gross <hi>inconsistency</hi> with <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,</hi>) exclude us from the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> for not <hi>believing</hi> the Articles themselves dispense with, in those which they make <hi>Members</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>But, (to return from this short digression to our <hi>main design,</hi>) let us, who engage our <hi>Posterity</hi> by <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,</hi> to fill up the <hi>vacancies</hi> made by <hi>death</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Christ;</hi> take a proportionable care of their <hi>Education;</hi> ground them throughly in all true <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Principles,</hi> and <hi>inure</hi> them constantly to the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the <hi>undoubted duties</hi> of <hi>Christianity,</hi> from their <hi>very Infancy:</hi> For we are told by God himself, that is the most probable way to keep them from <hi>Apostacy.

               <note place="margin">Prov. 22. 6.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But, especially, let us not only by <hi>verbal,</hi> but also by <hi>real instruction</hi> (I mean, holy example, in <hi>living</hi> and <hi>dying well,</hi> confirm them in the <hi>belief</hi> of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> and <hi>Punishments</hi> of the <hi>world to come;</hi> together with an <hi>assurance,</hi> that we do firmly <hi>believe</hi> them our selves.

            <p>The <hi>rational assurance which succeeding Christians have</hi>
               <note place="margin">

               <hi>of their Predecessors interest in a future Resurrection to a blessed immortality, conduceth much to the confirmation of them in the belief and practice of Christianity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the <hi>Apostle</hi>'s <hi>Argument</hi> in the <hi>Text,</hi> is plainly founded upon this <hi>supposition,</hi> that <hi>those that are baptized for the dead,</hi> would be apt to <hi>waver,</hi> (as those that were at a loss <hi>what to do;</hi>) except they were <hi>rationally assured,</hi> that those in whose places they <hi>succeed,</hi> should
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:64010:12"/>
               <hi>rise again,</hi> to that <hi>blessed immortality</hi> which in this <hi>Chapter</hi> he doth so industriously <hi>assert,</hi> and <hi>illustrate.</hi> And (by consequence) intimates, that the <hi>belief</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of would contribute much to their <hi>settlement.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he makes use of a motive, which is, (in its due place) so rational in it self, and so agreeable to humanity to be influenced by: That it hath always and in all Ages of the world, been highly prevalent with those of all <hi>Religions:</hi> Men every where having been concerned for their <hi>several</hi> ways of Worship, according to the <hi>persuasions</hi> they had imbibed, (whether true, or false,) of the <hi>happy future state</hi> of some at least, that had been <hi>founders,</hi> or <hi>eminent Professors</hi> of them.</p>
            <p>For though indeed, it be but a weak Argument, <hi>alone,</hi> for any man to <hi>chuse</hi> a <hi>Religion</hi> upon; that his <hi>Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers lived and died in it,</hi> and he has such, and such <hi>Reasons</hi> which prevail with him to think them transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to an <hi>happy estate</hi> in <hi>another world:</hi> (a fallacy where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with all the <hi>Romanists</hi> a while since fixed divers of this Nation that were wavering, to their <hi>Communion,</hi> and prejudic'd them, against the <hi>Reformation:</hi>) Yet it may be an <hi>inducement</hi> of great force to be used <hi>together</hi> with, and in <hi>subordination</hi> to, those other grounds and motives, which upon diligent inquiry into the nature of any Religion, do <hi>principally</hi> sway his <hi>Election;</hi> that he hath as good evidence, as matters of that sort will bear, of the <hi>felicity of those,</hi> (at least <hi>some</hi> of those) who have <hi>died</hi> in it.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, God himself, knowing how much <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances</hi> and <hi>Examples</hi> tending to our rational satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in this particular, are wont to influence the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of mankind, (as I but now told you:) hath in <hi>all Ages</hi> of the world, (more or less,) condescended
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:64010:12"/> to recommend his true <hi>Religion</hi> to men, by some <hi>indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitable attestations</hi> concerning the <hi>Eternal blessedness</hi> of divers Persons, who have eminently <hi>professed</hi> it, <hi>lived</hi> as great <hi>Examples,</hi> in conformity to it, or <hi>dyed</hi> as <hi>Champions</hi> for it.</p>
            <p>Thus in the <hi>old world,</hi> before the deluge, he dealt with <hi>Enoch;</hi> whom, having <hi>walked with God</hi> above Three hundred Years, (that is, been an <hi>eminently good and holy man</hi> for so long time on Earth,) God took (as says <hi>Moses) Gen. 5. 24. Translated, (i. e.</hi> to an happy estate in another world) <hi>without seeing of Death,</hi> (says the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle) <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 5. having <hi>before his translation</hi> attested, by some Divine Testimony or other, <hi>that he pleased God:</hi> and that Testimony such, (as in the <hi>Verse</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing it is exprest,) as might give grounds of <hi>belief</hi> to mankind, not only <hi>that there is a God, but also that there is such a God,</hi> as is a <hi>rewarder of them that dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently seek him,</hi> as <hi>Enoch</hi> had done.</p>
            <p>I will not positively assert, that he dealt in the same manner with <hi>Melchisedek</hi> afterward; but it may (I think,) deserve our consideration whether that <hi>Phrase</hi> of the <hi>Apostle</hi> concerning him, that he was <hi>one that had no end of life,</hi> Heb. 7. 3. may not admit of a like In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation with that of <hi>Enoch</hi> not seeing of <hi>death</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned.</p>
            <p>But sure I am, that in reference to <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> God's known owning them in a special manner whilst they lived, gave all the <hi>Jewish</hi> Nation such an assurance of their <hi>felicity</hi> after <hi>death,</hi> as yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our Saviour the occasion of mentioning it as a thing generally believed, describing that felicity too which good and holy men of all Countries in the world shall enjoy in Heaven, by the Periphrasis of <hi>sitting with

            <p>And I should think the wish of <hi>Balaam,</hi> on such an occasion, should be natural to all mankind; That they <hi>may dye the death of the righteous, gone before them, and that their latter end may be like theirs:</hi> for the <hi>Wish</hi> (tho a bad man's) is good; provided, that it be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with an <hi>industrious</hi> use of the <hi>means</hi> by which it is to be effected.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Let us, therefore, who <hi>wish,</hi> and <hi>hope</hi> to <hi>sit down with them</hi> in that <hi>Kingdom</hi> hereafter, follow the <hi>track</hi> of their <hi>steps</hi> here; and then we may warrantably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, that at the <hi>Resurrection of the just,</hi> we shall <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take</hi> with them in all those <hi>happy circumstances</hi> in which they shall then, in conjunction with all holy men of all ages, for ever be.</p>
            <p>This, the being <hi>baptized for our dead Predecessors</hi> in the <hi>general Profession of Christianity</hi> (according to the <hi>larger sense</hi> of my <hi>Text,</hi>) calls for, from us all. But, considering what a <hi>thick cloud</hi> of those our <hi>Predecessors,</hi> in this very nation, were also <hi>Confessors,</hi> and <hi>Martyrs</hi> for our holy Religion, in which they died; and of whom, I think I may say, that in holy <hi>Courage</hi> and <hi>Resolution</hi> to <hi>dye,</hi> and encouraging <hi>comfortable circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances</hi> in the <hi>manner</hi> of their <hi>dying,</hi> they were not infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to the most <hi>Primitive Martyrs:</hi> It will not be amiss, in the <hi>close</hi> of this <hi>Discourse,</hi> farther to tell you; that it is not impossible some of us may also be called to those <hi>Trials,</hi> wherein we may in those particulars too, which relate to suffering, stand in need of setting before us their <hi>Examples.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am sure, it was <hi>no long time since,</hi> that the most of us had before us, (in humane probability,) no other <hi>Prospect,</hi> than that, of <hi>succeeding</hi> them in their <hi>Chains,</hi> their <hi>Racks</hi> and <hi>Tortures,</hi> and <hi>cruel Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:</hi> And surely we had done so before this time, but that God by an unexpected Providence, raised us up a
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:64010:15"/>
               <hi>Deliverer,</hi> who, (to his <hi>own</hi> irreparable <hi>hazard,</hi> if he had <hi>miscarried</hi> in the Attempt,) has yet saved us, <hi>all, beyond our hopes,</hi> and <hi>many</hi> of us even <hi>against our wills,</hi> from the <hi>hands of those that hated us:</hi> and hitherto respi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted us from the <hi>Fiery Trial.</hi> By which, if there be any, who, being prepared for it themselves, may think it an injury done them, that they are thereby defeated of an opportunity of <hi>witnessing</hi> to the <hi>Truth</hi> of that <hi>Doctrine of Allegiance</hi> and <hi>Passive Obedience,</hi> which <hi>beyond others</hi> they have <hi>contended</hi> for, by a signally <hi>Loyal Martyrdom:</hi> yet one would think they might without difficulty be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed withal, <hi>to forgive him this wrong:</hi> as consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that to those many others who were not so well<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 23.</note> disposed for <hi>present suffering</hi> as they, ('tis to be hoped,) were, it was certainly a very seasonable kindness, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure them such a reprieve from it, as might give them a larger time to provide for it: and that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, though hindered from being <hi>Martyrs actu,</hi> yet, (being such, <hi>voto,</hi> in a ready disposition to have been so, if God had offered them the <hi>opportunity,</hi>) are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered to lose nothing of the <hi>weight</hi> of their <hi>Crown,</hi> from that good God, who <hi>accepts</hi> the <hi>will,</hi> (where men <hi>can</hi> do <hi>no more</hi> than will) for the <hi>deed,</hi> and <hi>rewards</hi> it accordingly.</p>
            <p>However, I think, I may presume to <hi>predict,</hi> that our <hi>Posterity</hi> will hardly be of their mind, if the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of the present Agitations in all <hi>Europe</hi> fall not much beneath expectation: for they will then find themselves <hi>secured</hi> in the peaceable <hi>Possession</hi> of their <hi>Holy Religion,</hi> and all their other <hi>dearest Enjoyments,</hi> which surely they will value the more, because reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from so desperate an hazard; and in the grateful Sense thereof, rise up to <hi>call him blessed</hi> (whatever we
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:64010:16"/> think of him) <hi>who hath wrought so great a Deliverance</hi> for our <hi>Israel,</hi> at so needful a Season.</p>
            <p>But yet, I would not have any of us to look upon our selves, as so far secured from all <hi>Danger;</hi> that we may say (with <hi>Agag) surely the bitterness of Death</hi> is (totally) <hi>past,</hi> as being taught by <hi>Experience,</hi> not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny weeks since, how unexpectedly new occasions of just fear may return upon us; such as none but an All-seeing <hi>Eye</hi> could <hi>foresee,</hi> and no <hi>Hand</hi> but an <hi>Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent</hi> one could deliver us from.</p>
            <p>Which occasionally <hi>minds me,</hi> and calls on me to <hi>mind you,</hi> how much we all are obliged to a grateful acknowledgment of the mercy of that Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which, when we were almost surprised at una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares with a <hi>dreadful Invasion</hi> from those, who, (hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been bred to the practice of such Barbarities in our Neighbour Nations,) would (in pursuance of the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> of their <hi>blind Devotion,</hi>) have thought it a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious Service to God to have exercised the same up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us: hath <hi>broken that design,</hi> ('tis to be hoped, for some years, at least,) by <hi>breaking their Ships</hi> (as those<note place="margin">

               <hi>strength is laid waste.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A <hi>Providence,</hi> by which we are indeed for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, <hi>safe:</hi> but yet ought not to be tempted thereby, to be <hi>secure.</hi> It is wisdom, to prepare for the <hi>worst</hi> that <hi>may come,</hi> though it never <hi>do come:</hi> and to <hi>arm our selves,</hi> (as St. <hi>Peter,</hi> in this very case of being called <hi>to suffer</hi>) adviseth,) <hi>with the same mind</hi> with the holy <hi>Martyrs</hi> who have gone to Heaven in a <hi>Fiery-Chariot,</hi> (the Flames, I mean wherein they suffered) <hi>before us:</hi>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:64010:16"/> as being assured, that God (in answer to that <hi>devout Petition</hi> which in our <hi>Liturgy</hi> we offer to him with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to them) will, if we <hi>follow their Examples make us partakers with them of his Heavenly Kingdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if (to draw to a conclusion,) by God's tender and indulgent Providence continuing to watch over us for our Protection, all those <hi>Fears</hi> with which we dread the <hi>Oppressor-general</hi> of all <hi>Europe,</hi> shall in the Issue be proved <hi>vain,</hi> and we of this Generation shall (after all these dangers,) be permitted to <hi>die in our Nests,</hi> and be <hi>gathered to our Graves in Peace:</hi> We ought nevertheless to make it our great care, that by living holily, we may <hi>die comfortably,</hi> and <hi>finish our course with that Joy</hi> and <hi>Consolation in the</hi> Lord, which may justly give those that are <hi>baptized</hi> to fill <hi>our rooms,</hi> encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to <hi>follow our Examples,</hi> with a well grounded Assurance, that in so doing, they shall at the last, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy with us, all the consummate <hi>Happiness</hi> of a <hi>blessed Resurrection.</hi> Which <hi>God grant</hi> us all for his sake, who <hi>is the Resurrection, and the Life;</hi> and who hath by our <hi>Baptism, begotten us again to a lively hope of ours, by his own Resurrection from the dead.</hi> Amen.</p>
